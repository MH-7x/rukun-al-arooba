          cash in hand within 2-3 hours of first contact.

          and professional service.
        </p>

          Unlike online marketplaces where you deal with unknown sellers, risk
          scams, and have no recourse if something goes wrong, we provide:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Government-registered business you can trust</li>
          <li>Physical showroom to inspect furniture before buying</li>

          and restoration requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          We explain our valuation to every seller, showing how each factor
          affects the price. This transparency is rare in the industry, where
          most buyers simply throw out a low number hoping you&lsquo;ll accept.

        <p>
          One of the most common mistakes when purchasing furniture is
          misjudging the size of your space. We strongly recommend that you
          measure the length, width, and height of the area where you plan to
          place the new furniture, and be sure to also account for doorways,
          staircases, and hallways to ensure a clear path for delivery.

          To make this process seamless and stress-free, Rukun Al Arooba offers

    question:
      "Why should I sell to you instead of online marketplaces like Dubizzle?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          While online marketplaces might seem convenient, the reality for most
          sellers is frustrating and time-consuming. You are often required to
          field dozens of messages from time-wasters, engage in endless
          negotiations with bargain hunters, and coordinate all pickup logistics
          yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worse, the process exposes you to the security risk of having
          strangers visit your home with no guarantees. When you work with a
          professional dealer like Rukun Al Arooba, these concerns are
          eliminated.
