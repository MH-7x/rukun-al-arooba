          cash in hand within 2-3 hours of first contact.

          The difference is night and day. We`&lsquo;re a registered business
          with a physical showroom, offering warranties, quality restoration,
          and professional service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike online marketplaces where you deal with unknown sellers, risk
          scams, and have no recourse if something goes wrong, we provide:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Government-registered business you can trust</li>
          <li>Physical showroom to inspect furniture before buying</li>

          and restoration requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          We explain our valuation to every seller, showing how each factor
          affects the price. This transparency is rare in the industry, where
          most buyers simply throw out a low number hoping you`&lsquo;ll accept.
